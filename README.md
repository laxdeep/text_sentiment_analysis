# text_sentiment_analysis

The Sentiment Analysis mini project is based on python language. It utilizes the TextBlob 
library along with Streamlit and Pandas to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The 
project offers two primary methods for analyzing sentiment: direct input and excel file 
upload

1. Direct Input:
Users can input text directly into the application interface. The TextBlob library is then used 
to analyze the sentiment of the input text, providing information on polarity (positive, 
negative, or neutral) and subjectivity (the degree of opinion). The results are displayed in an 
intuitive and user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.

3. File Upload:
Alternatively, users have the option to upload excel files containing text data. The 
application processes the uploaded file using Pandas to extract and analyze the sentiment 
of the text data contained within. This feature allows users to perform sentiment analysis 
on larger datasets efficiently.
